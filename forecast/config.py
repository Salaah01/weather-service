"""Configurations for the forecast app".
This module should not do any calculations but instead act as a central hub
for containing certain variables which will be referenced throughout the
forecast app.

Any variables which may change and/or is referenced by multiple modules should
be referenced here so that any future updates can be done in the config thus
preventing having to search for variables throughout all the modules.
